# Welcome to Your Redesigned Website Project!

This project was generated by **redesignr.ai** to help you quickly launch your modern, responsive website.

## Getting Started

- This is a static website with HTML, LICENSE, and README files.
- To convert this into a **React** project:
  - Break down the HTML files into components.
  - Use React's state and props to manage interactivity.
- We use **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Tailwind makes it easy to customize your design quickly.
